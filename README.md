# My_Codes
# The epsilon greedy and UCB are algorithms used to solve the multi - armed bandits problem. The problem formulated as per the repo SOC 2022
# The data scraping codes are various data scrapers built to load the stock market data
# data scraping is also dine directly using the yahoo finance library
# hill climbing problem 
# 1. Initialize policy π with random weights θ
#2. Initialize θbest (our best guess for the weights θ)
#3. Initialize Gbest​ (our highest return G we have gotten so far)
#4. Collect a single episode with θbest, and record the return G
#5. If G​ > Gbest then θbest​ ← θ and Gbest​ ← G
#6. Add a little bit of random noise to θbest​, to get a new set of weights θ
# Repeat steps 4–6 until Environment solved.!
